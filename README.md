# Aalborg University Beamer Theme
This theme is **not** an offical theme endorsed by Aalborg University.
The initial design was established by [René Rydhof Hansen](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~rrh/).
[Thomas Kobber Panum](https://github.com/tpanum) have then further modified it and provided a unique frontpage layout.

## Gallery
Here is a visual example based on the [example.tex file](example.tex).

## Installation
1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/tpanum/aau-beamer-template/releases).
2. Download the most recent version
3. Extract the style files (`*.sty`) into the directory of your beamer presentation.
4. Then simply just add `\usetheme{Aalborg}` in your beamer presentation file.

*If this still remain confusing, take a look at the [example.tex file](example.tex).*

I am no longer employed at Aalborg University, so I do not expect frequent updates.
However, pull requests are more than welcome.
